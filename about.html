      <h2>About The Owner</h2>
      <img alt="Karen Lee" src="Karen Lee - CPA About Us 1.jpg" style="width: 150px; float: left; height: 225px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
      <p>Karen Mitsuko Lee (formerly Higashi) was born in Southern California but her family moved back to Hawaii when she was one years old, so she is proud to be a fourth generation Japanese with deep Hawaiian roots. She decided accounting suited her personality and natural abilities in high school and chose the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, WA to further her education. She excelled at the University of Puget Sound and was a cum laude graduate with Bachelor of Arts degrees in Accounting and Business Leadership in 1997.</p>
      <br>
      <p>After spending two summers working in the tax department of Safeco Insurance she realized that tax work was for her. She chose Bauer Evans in Everett, WA to gain some additional work experience in public accounting. She enjoyed six and a half years developing trusted relationships with her clients and gaining many valuable accounting skills such preparing audits, compilation, reviews, sales & use taxes, payroll taxes, small business consulting as well as preparing tax returns for individuals, businesses, non-profits, trusts, and estates.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Desiring to spend more time with her family, she left Bauer Evans to join the private sector in hopes of a more balanced work schedule. She became the Director of Corporate Tax at Noble House Hotels & Resorts in Kirkland, WA and spent the next 9 years there. She became a key member of the finance team and was able to help navigate the company through the tax complexities of a preferred equity investor and over the years took over managing the 401(k) plan for the entire company, transitioning payroll processors for all of the hotels to save over $150K in fees while handling all of the tax compliance work and maintaining numerous sets of books for its many companies.</p>
      <br>
      <p>With the help and encouragement of her family she decided the time was right to start her own accounting practice in the fall of 2012. Her mission is to create a lifestyle practice that maximizes the benefits of technology to service clients more efficiently and effectively. Her proactive approach to accounting frees her clients’ from the worries of audits and allows them to rest assured that they are paying the least amount of taxes as possible. Her constant drive for continual improvement and excellence in all she does is what drives this company.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Karen and Charlton are the proud parents to Hannah, Isaac and Jonathan and they enjoy spending time nurturing them to be the leaders of our next generation. As former church planters, Karen and Charlton are passionate about helping to train and lead short term mission teams to Cambodia in the future. They currently reside in Renton, WA.</p>
