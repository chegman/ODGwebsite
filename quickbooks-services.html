    <ul>
      <li>You save time on bookkeeping and paperwork because many of simple bookkeeping tasks are handled automatically making it easier to run your business.</li>
      <li>You can easily generate the reports with the information you need, so you always know where your business stands. You instantly know whether you're making money and whether your business is healthy.</li>

      <li>Your business can grow with QuickBooks. QuickBooks will help you design a business plan to use when trying to secure a small business loan or line of credit or to plan for the future.

      <li>You can rest assured knowing that QuickBooks is a stable, reliable and proven product. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses throughout the world have chosen QuickBooks as their accounting software. You can't go wrong with a software program with such an extensive installed user base.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>QuickBooks Setup</h2>
    <p>Although QuickBooks is designed for the layman to understand, the initial setup and installation must be done correctly in order for future information to be accurate.</p>
    <p>All information necessary to setup manual accounting records is also necessary to setup and install QuickBooks on your desktop. This task is even more complicated if you switch from manual accounting operations to QuickBooks in the middle of the year.</p>
    <p>Which accounting method will you use? What chart of accounts do you need for your business? How do you handle beginning balances?</p>
    <p>An expert can easily answer all of these questions and complete the initial setup and Installation in a timely manner. In addition, your accounting employees receive training on the accounting software to enhance their performance.</p>
    <p>How much does it cost? We first want to find out a little more about your business and your accounting records before we quote you an exact price. Rest assured that we work with many small business owners and our rates are designed to fit the budgets of our clients.</p>
